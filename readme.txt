The best anti-spam protection to block spam comments and spam in a contact form. The most trusted antispam solution for WordPress and WooCommerce.


== Installation ==

Upload the BLASTREAM plugin to your blog, activate it, and then you can use the [blastream_room] short code.
Which is configurable.


== Configuration  ==
There are 3 parameters in order to use it: "Slug", "Width", "Height'
Slug: name of the channel to display, the short code will write "no_channel" in case the channel doesn't exist
Width: the width of the Blastream window integrated within your blog
Height: the height of the Blastream window integrated within your blog
There are two ways of using the shortcode:

1. Within the editor:
Like this: [blastream_room slug="slug_name" width="450px" height="200px"] 

2. With the settings:
Go to settings "Blastream Room Default Setting" and there you can set the parameters.
Then you can just use the [blastream_room] short code within your blog.
